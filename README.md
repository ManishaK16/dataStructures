Width = horizontal distance between two bars or the difference between their indices.

Length = shorter of the two bars.

Area = (Length * Width)

Area = min(a[1], a[8]) * (8 - 1)
     = min(8, 7) * 7
     = 7 * 7
     = 49
     
 # pointer : no data type (can be typecasted)
 
 void *ptr = &n (& adress)
 
 *(int*)ptr == typecasting a pointer
 
 we cannot deference a void pointer
 
 malloc alloc returns a void pointer so they allocate memory at runtime
